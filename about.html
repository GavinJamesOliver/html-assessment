        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Grow foods is an innovative new farming game utilizing new technology
          like the C programming language as well as CLI graphics. In Grow Foods
          you play the farmer and disgraced ruler Johnthaniel whose goal is to
          establish a farm on land corrupted by his use of the Omega Magic. Will
          Johnthaniel be able to overcome the mistakes of his past and restore
          his kingdom to its former glory or will he fall victim to the
          corrupting powers of the Omega Magic. Who knows? Not me I haven't
          finished the game yet.
        </p>

          A description of the music and composer for this game.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>
          For this game I decided to go with the music created by the famous
          singer Will Smith. More specifically I thought I would use his work on
          the hit film Wild Wild West as it most fits this game in both a story
          and artistic sense. Wild Wild West is so fitting because after the
          Omega Magic corrupted Johnthanial he became evil and turned the lands
          he once ruled with a kind heart into the Wild Wild West. Also Wild
          Wild West much like Will Smith <b>SLAPS.</b> Please note that Will
          Smith has not yet aggreed to work on this project.
